        and  could not be happier. i am not going to cover this with all this sappy shit about how much i love her
        because she already knows that. She knows that she is everything to me. She knows that i would do anything for
        her. She knows she is the reason i wake up with a smile on my face becasue I get to see a silly video of her on
        snap being cute. I honestly don't know what else to type because i have said almost everything to her a hundred
        times before. i guess im just really greatful to have her in my life.</p>
    <h4 id="About">About Me</h4>
    <p id="aboutText">Hello. This is my very first website. My name is Nicholas Callisher. I graduted from GCC with a
        degree in computer support and operations with a certificate in computer repair. I decided halfway through my
        major that i didnt want a career directly in that field. I knew I liked computers so i thought i would give
        coding a try. I am still learning and trying my best to make something worth looking at. I'm not sure if this
        is for me but there is only one way to find out. </p>
